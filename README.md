# DragNDrop_SamplePortfolio
## Key Features of a Drag-and-Drop Portfolio
* Customizable Layout: Users can rearrange sections (e.g., About, Projects, Skills) with drag-and-drop functionality.
* Interactive Design: Integrates JavaScript or libraries like React, Vue.js, or vanilla drag-and-drop APIs.
* Dynamic Content Updates: Allow users to edit portfolio details inline or through a simple form.
* Responsive and Accessible: Works on various devices and is keyboard-friendly.

Enhancements
Persistence: Save the new layout using local storage, cookies, or a backend API.
Styling: Add animations (e.g., smooth transitions using CSS transition properties).
Additional Features: Allow editing text inline, adding new sections, or uploading images.
This structure provides a solid foundation to create an interactive drag-and-drop portfolio.
## How It Works
Dynamic Additions: Students can click the "Add New Block" button to generate a new content block where they can:

## Add text or descriptions.
Embed videos (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.).
Insert images via <img> tags.
Paste code snippets inside the <textarea> or <code> blocks.
Editable and Customizable:
Each block starts with placeholders that can be edited inline. Students can expand their portfolio by embedding custom HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

## Content Removal:
Each block includes a "Remove Block" button to delete unnecessary entries.
